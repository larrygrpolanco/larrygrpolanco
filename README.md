## Hi, I'm Larry

I build tools that solve real problems in education and research. My work lives at the intersection of linguistics, data analysis, and practical application—where technical solutions meet human needs.

### What I'm about

I see technology as a means rather than an end—a powerful toolkit for addressing challenges that matter. Whether I'm automating research processes, building educational applications, or analyzing communication patterns, I'm always thinking about the people who will benefit.

### What I'm working on

- **[Taped Chinese](tapedchinese.com)**: Digitized, modernized, and updated web application of the FSI public domain Chinese curriculum. LLM powered exercises were added to each unit to address the weaknesses of the original course and make learning more relevant and personal
- **[Fulbright Planner](https://github.com/larrygrullon/eta-lesson-planner)**: A web app that generates context-specific lesson plans for educators in Taiwan, saving hours of planning time while improving instructional quality


### My approach

I believe in building tools that:
- Solve legitimate problems, not theoretical ones
- Respect users' time and cognitive load
- Extend human capabilities rather than replace them
- Are accessible to everyone who needs them

My diverse background—spanning music, education, construction, and research—gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving. I've learned that meaningful innovation happens when we connect seemingly unrelated ideas.

### Let's connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects that help people learn, communicate, or access resources more effectively. If you're working on something along these lines, reach out!

    return "I don't like technology just for technology's sake. I build to solve real problems, treating people as ends in themselves, not the tools we create."
