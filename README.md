## Hi, I'm Larry

I like to build tools that solve problems in education and research. My work follows my interests in linguistics, data analysis, and practical applications where technical solutions meet human needs. I believe technology should serve as a means, not an end.

### What I'm working on

Here are a couple of projects I'm actively developing:

-   **[The Office Agent](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/office-agent-simulation)**: The Office Agent Simulation creates a virtual office environment populated by AI agents that exhibit believable behaviors, interactions, and cognitive processes. Based on the research paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior," this project ports the original architecture to a more accessible system. *(Tech: Python, Phaser, FastAPI)*

-   **[Taped Chinese](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/standard-chinese-platform)**: Digitized, modernized, and updated version of the FSI public domain Chinese curriculum. I implemented "Relevant World Practice," a feature that analyzes unit content, extracts key vocabulary and grammar patterns, and generates personalized exercises. This means address the original course's weakness of over-focusing on form by creating contextually relevant practice opportunities for learners based on their profiles and goals.
    *(Tech: SvelteKit, Supabase, LLM APIs)*

### Selected Past Work
    
-   **[Fulbright Planner](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/eta-lesson-planner)**: An LLM-powered tool creating context-aware lesson plans for Fulbright educators in Taiwan. Developed iteratively through testing with ~50 colleagues, this app uses progressive prompting techniques to generate comprehensive plans in logical phases. Backend analysis of app logs informed prompt optimizations to align with actual educator needs, resulting in significant time savings while maintaining pedagogical quality.
    *(Tech: Python, Svelte, Anthropic Claude API)*

-   **[SABR-automated-coding](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/SABR-automated-coding)**: A prototype tool that transforms qualitative research coding using LLMs. This system automatically identifies linguistic and thematic patterns in educational transcripts, reducing what typically takes researchers days into minutes. The backend implements a sophisticated prompt architecture that leverages few-shot learning and detailed instruction tuning to apply specific research codes with explanations. Validation testing against expert human coders showed promising agreement metrics, demonstrating the potential for AI-augmented qualitative methodology. *(Tech: Python, LLM APIs, CSV processing)*

-   **[YouTube Academic Spoken English Corpus (YASEC)](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/youtube-transcript-corpus-study)**: A foundational project for me involving the creation and analysis of a 58-million-word corpus from YouTube academic video transcripts. This was my first major effort in using code (Python scripts) to systematically scrape, process, and analyze a large dataset to answer specific research questions about the lexical demands of online academic English.
    *(Tech: Python, youtube-transcript-api)*

### My approach

My development philosophy centers on creating tools that are genuinely useful and human-centered. I believe in building tools that:

-   Solve legitimate, experienced problems, not just theoretical ones.
-   Respect users' time and cognitive load.
-   Extend human capabilities rather than aiming to replace them.
-   Are accessible and intuitive for those who need them.

My background—spanning music, education, construction, and research—gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving. I've learned that meaningful innovation often happens when we connect seemingly unrelated ideas and focus on the underlying human needs.

### Let's connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects that help people learn, communicate, or access resources more effectively. If you're working on something along these lines, or if my approach resonates with you, feel free to reach out!
