## Hi, I'm Larry

I build tools that solve real problems in education and research. My work lives at the intersection of linguistics, data analysis, and practical application—where technical solutions meet human needs.

### What I'm about

I believe technology should serve as a means, not an end—a powerful toolkit for addressing challenges that genuinely matter. Whether I'm automating research processes, building educational applications, or analyzing communication patterns, my focus remains on the people who will benefit and the real-world value delivered. I strive to build things that enhance understanding and connection.

### What I'm working on

Here are a couple of projects I'm actively developing:

-   **[Hobbesian Mind Simulator](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/hobbesian-mind)**: A philosophical AI system implementing Thomas Hobbes' model of human cognition from "Leviathan" (1651). This agent-based system processes input through sequential stages mirroring Hobbes' materialist theory—from sense perception through imagination to trains of thought—creating responses grounded in historical philosophy. (Tech: Python, asyncio, DeepSeek LLM API)

-   **[Taped Chinese](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/standard-chinese-platform)**: Digitized, modernized, and updated web application of the FSI public domain Chinese curriculum. LLM powered exercises were added to each unit to address the weaknesses of the original course and make learning more relevant and personal.
    *(Tech: SvelteKit, Supabase, LLM APIs)*

### Selected Past Work
    
-   **[Fulbright Planner](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/eta-lesson-planner)**: An AI-powered tool creating context-aware lesson plans for Fulbright educators in Taiwan. Developed iteratively with user feedback to save planning time and enhance instructional quality.
    *(Tech: Python, Svelte, Anthropic Claude API)*

-   **[YouTube Academic Spoken English Corpus (YASEC)](https://github.com/larrygrpolanco/youtube-transcript-corpus-study)**: A foundational project for me involving the creation and analysis of a 58-million-word corpus from YouTube academic video transcripts. This was my first major effort in using code (Python scripts) to systematically scrape, process, and analyze a large dataset to answer specific research questions about the lexical demands of online academic English.
    *(Tech: Python, youtube-transcript-api)*

### My approach

My development philosophy centers on creating tools that are genuinely useful and human-centered. I believe in building tools that:

-   Solve legitimate, experienced problems, not just theoretical ones.
-   Respect users' time and cognitive load.
-   Extend human capabilities rather than aiming to replace them.
-   Are accessible and intuitive for those who need them.

My background—spanning music, education, construction, and research—gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving. I've learned that meaningful innovation often happens when we connect seemingly unrelated ideas and focus on the underlying human needs.

### Let's connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects that help people learn, communicate, or access resources more effectively. If you're working on something along these lines, or if my approach resonates with you, feel free to reach out!
