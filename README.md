## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Larry

I build tools that solve real problems in education and research. My work lives at the intersection of linguistics, data analysis, and practical applicationâ€”where technical solutions meet human needs.

### What I'm about

I see technology as a means rather than an endâ€”a powerful toolkit for addressing challenges that matter. Whether I'm automating research processes, building educational applications, or analyzing communication patterns, I'm always thinking about the people who will benefit.

### What I'm working on

- **[Fulbright Planner](https://github.com/larrygrullon/eta-lesson-planner)**: A web app that generates context-specific lesson plans for educators in Taiwan, saving hours of planning time while improving instructional quality


### My approach

I believe in building tools that:
- Solve legitimate problems, not theoretical ones
- Respect users' time and cognitive load
- Extend human capabilities rather than replace them
- Are accessible to everyone who needs them

My diverse backgroundâ€”spanning music, education, construction, and researchâ€”gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving. I've learned that meaningful innovation happens when we connect seemingly unrelated ideas.

### Let's connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects that help people learn, communicate, or access resources more effectively. If you're working on something along these lines, reach out!

```python
def my_philosophy():
    return "Technology is most powerful when it amplifies our capacity to understand and help one another."
